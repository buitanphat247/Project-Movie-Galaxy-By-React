<h2>
    API Usage
</h2>

This project utilizes the MovieDB API to fetch movie data and display information within the application. The API provides endpoints for searching movies, retrieving details about specific movies, and fetching images and trailers.

### API Source

The movie data is sourced from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). To use the API, you will need to sign up for an API key, which is required for authentication and access to their endpoints.

### Example Usage

```javascript
// Ví dụ về sử dụng Axios để gọi API từ TMDb và lấy danh sách phim phổ biến
import axios from "axios";

const API_KEY = "your_tmdb_api_key";
const BASE_URL = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3";

const fetchPopularMovies = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`${BASE_URL}/movie/popular`, {
      params: {
        api_key: API_KEY,
      },
    });
    return response.data.results; // Return the list of popular movies
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching popular movies:", error);
    return []; // Handle the error accordingly
  }
};

export { fetchPopularMovies };
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
